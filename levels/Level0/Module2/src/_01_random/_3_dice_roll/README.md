## Goal:
   Use a Random object to generate random integers so your code can roll different numbers on a dice.
## Steps:
1. Create a Random object.
2. Generate a random number between 1 and 6.
3. Change the code to display the dice image to match the number each time the "CLICK HERE TO ROLL" button is pressed.
4. Test your code to make sure all 6 sides are displayed.
