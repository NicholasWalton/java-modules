## Goal:
   Use random numbers to make a lottery ticket!
## Steps:
1. Add a new class for the Lottery Numbers recipe.
2. Get 6 random numbers to put on your lottery ticket
3. Display the selected numbers to the user in a pop-up (see below)
    
(All 6 random numbers must appear on the same pop-up [i.e. the user should not have to click "ok" 6 times])
4. Bonus: set the title of the pop-up to show it is a lottery ticket.
