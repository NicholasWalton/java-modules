   ## Steps:
   <ol id="stepList">
    <li>
     Create a for loop that will repeat until the program ends.
    </li>
    <li>
     Inside the loop, call the tryCode method using the for loop variable for the code.
    </li>
    <li>
     The tryCode method will end the program when the correct code is guessed.
    </li>
    <li>
     Run the program and see all the guesses being printed to the console.
    </li>
    <li>
     Bonus: Can you change the loop so that the safe will be cracked more quickly?
