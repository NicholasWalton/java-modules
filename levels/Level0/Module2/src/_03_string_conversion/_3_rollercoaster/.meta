  ## Goal:


  Check if a person is tall enough to ride the roller coaster!


  ## Steps:


  1. Ask the user what height they are (in inches)

  2. If they are 48" or taller, tell them they can go on the coaster alone.

  3. If they are between 42" and 47" tall, tell them they need to ride with someone
  else.

  4. If they are less than 42" tall, tell them they need to grow more.
