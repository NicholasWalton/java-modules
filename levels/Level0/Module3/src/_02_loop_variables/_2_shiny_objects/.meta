  ## Goal:


  Use input from a user to control the number of repetitions of a for loop.


  ## Steps:


  1. Call the playMisterZee method. Run the program to make sure it works.

  2. Ask the user how many shiny objects they would like

  3. Use a for loop that repeats the method call for as many times as the user specified.
