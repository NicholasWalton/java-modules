## Goal:
   Use input from a user to control the number of repetitions of a for loop.
## Steps:
1. Call the playMisterZee method. Run the program to make sure it works.
2. Ask the user how many shiny objects they would like
3. Use a for loop that repeats the method call for as many times as the user specified.
