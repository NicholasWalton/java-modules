  \ a high low game.\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div id=\"recipeRightColumn\">\n  <div id=\"\
  recipeSteps\">\n   ## Steps:\n   <ol id=\"stepList\">\n    <li>\n     Get a random\
  \ number between 1 and 100. Hint: use a Random object\n    </li>\n    <li>\n   \

  \     If their guess is too low, tell them it is too low.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n\
