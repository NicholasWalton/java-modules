 <div id="recipeRightColumn">
  <div id="recipeSteps">
   ## Steps:
   <ol id="stepList">
    <li>
     Get a random number between 1 and 100. Hint: use a Random object
    </li>
    <li>
     Ask the user to guess what the number is.
    </li>
    <li>
     If their guess is correct, tell them they won and end the game.
    </li>
    <li>
     If their guess is too high, tell them it is too high.
    </li>
    <li>
     If their guess is too low, tell them it is too low.
    </li>
    <li>
     Use a for loop to repeat the above code 10 times. If they don't find the number after 10 tries, tell them they lost the game and tell them the number.
    </li>
   </ol>
