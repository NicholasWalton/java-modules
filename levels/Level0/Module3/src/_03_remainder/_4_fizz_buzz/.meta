  \ (%) to build FizzBuzz - a children's counting game.\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div\

  stepList\">\n    <li>\n     Write a loop to print all the numbers between 1 and\
  \ 20.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Now modify the  program so that any time a number\
  \ is divisible by 3, print \"fizz\" in place of the number. And instead of printing\
  \ numbers that are divisible by 5, print \"buzz\". For numbers that are divisible\
  \ by both 3 and 5, print \"fizzbuzz\".\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     If your code is\
  \ correct, the program will now print:\n     1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz,\
  \ buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz, 16, 17, fizz, 19, buzz\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n\
