<div id="recipeSteps">
## Steps:

<ol id="stepList">
<li>Ask the user to enter their name.</li>
<li>Use a loop to alternately modify each character of the name into uppercase and lowercase letters until a new "goofy" representation of their name has been constructed.


    For example, if they enter their name as <font color="green">Alexander Hamilton</font> 



                                their goofy name will be <font color="green">AlExAnDeR HaMiLtOn</font></li>
<li>Show the user the goofy version of their name in a pop-up.</li>
</ol>
