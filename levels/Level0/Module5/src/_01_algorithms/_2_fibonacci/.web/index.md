    <li>
     There is more than one way to code a solution to this. The following steps give you some guidelines for one of them.
    </li>
    <li>
     Declare and initialize three int variables: number1, number2, and sum.
    </li>
    <li>
     Initialize number1 and number2 to the first two numbers of the fibonacci sequence (0 and 1) and print both numbers.
    </li>
    <li>
     Use a for loop that calculates the sum of the two numbers and prints it. The for loop should repeat 10 times.
    </li>
    <li>
     Now try to figure out how to change the variables before the for loop repeats so the sequence of numbers is correct.
    </li>
