  # Prime or Not


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/prime.png"/>


  ## Goal:


  Ask the user for a number, then tell them if the number is prime!

  A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.


  ## Steps:


  1. Ask the user for a number (JOptionPane).

  2. Use a for loop, if statement, and modulo to find if the number is prime.

  3. If the number is divisible by any number other than 1 or itself, the number is
  not prime.
