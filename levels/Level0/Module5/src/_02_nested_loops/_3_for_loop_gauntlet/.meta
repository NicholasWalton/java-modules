text: "\n\n# For Loop Gauntlet\n\nThe goal of this assignment is to make you a master\
  \ of utilizing for loops. Complete all the for loop challenges on the paper. Please\
  \ read each challenge carefully and make sure that your for loops display exactly\
  \ what is asked. If you finish them all, try the bonus challenge.\n\n### Single\
  \ For-Loops\n\nWrite a for loop to do each the following:\n1. Display all numbers\
  \ from 0 to 100\n2. Display all numbers from 100 to 0\n3. Display all even numbers\
  \ from 2 to 100\n4. Display all odd numbers from 1 to 99\n5. Display all numbers\
  \ from 1 to 500. If the number is odd, print \u201Codd\u201D next to the number.\
  \ If the number is even, print \u201Ceven\u201D next to the number.\nEg:\n1 is odd\n\
  2 is even\n3 is odd\n4 is even\n5 is odd...etc.\n6. Display all multiples of 7 from\
  \ 0 to 777.\n7. Print all the years you were alive and how old you were in each.\
  \ e.g. \u201CIn 1979, i was 2 years old.\u201D (for a really old person)\n\n###\
  \ Nested For-Loops\n\nWrite nested for loops (a for loop inside another for loop)\
  \ to do the following:\n\n1. Display this output:\n0  0\n0  1\n0  2\n1  0\n1  1\n\
  1  2\n2  0\n2  1\n2  2\n2. Display the numbers 1 through 9 in a 3x3 square grid\
  \ like this:\n1  2  3\n4  5  6\n7  8  9\n3. Display the numbers 1 through 100 in\
  \ a 10x10 square grid.\n4. Display the following output:\n*\n*  *\n*  *  *\n*  *\
  \  *  *\n*  *  *  *  *\n*  *  *  *  *  *\n\n### **Bonus**\n\nWrite a for loop that\
  \ counts down from 100 to 0. However, the for loop must start with for(int i = 0;\
  \  and you may NOT have any code ABOVE your for loop.\n\n"
