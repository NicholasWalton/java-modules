text: "\n # For Loop Gauntlet\n The goal of this assignment is to make you a master\
  \ of utilizing for loops. Complete all the for loop challenges on the paper. Please\
  \ read each challenge carefully and make sure that your for loops display exactly\
  \ what is asked. If you finish them all, try the bonus challenge.\n ### Single For-Loops\n\
  \ Write a for loop to do each the following:\n 1. Display all numbers from 0 to\
  \ 100\n 2. Display all numbers from 100 to 0\n 3. Display all even numbers from\
  \ 2 to 100\n 4. Display all odd numbers from 1 to 99\n 5. Display all numbers from\
  \ 1 to 500. If the number is odd, print \u201Codd\u201D next to the number. If the\
  \ number is even, print \u201Ceven\u201D next to the number.\n Eg:\n 1 is odd\n\
  \ 2 is even\n 3 is odd\n 4 is even\n 5 is odd...etc.\n 6. Display all multiples\
  \ of 7 from 0 to 777.\n 7. Print all the years you were alive and how old you were\
  \ in each. e.g. \u201CIn 1979, i was 2 years old.\u201D (for a really old person)\n\
  \ ### Nested For-Loops\n Write nested for loops (a for loop inside another for loop)\
  \ to do the following:\n\n1. Display this output:\n 0\_\_0\n 0\_\_1\n 0\_\_2\n 1\_\
  \_0\n 1\_\_1\n 1\_\_2\n 2\_\_0\n 2\_\_1\n 2\_\_2\n 2. Display the numbers 1 through\
  \ 9 in a 3x3 square grid like this:\n 1\_\_2\_\_3\n 4\_\_5\_\_6\n 7\_\_8\_\_9\n\
  \ 3. Display the numbers 1 through 100 in a 10x10 square grid.\n 4. Display the\
  \ following output:\n *\n *\_\_*\n *\_\_*\_\_*\n *\_\_*\_\_*\_\_*\n *\_\_*\_\_*\_\
  \_*\_\_*\n *\_\_*\_\_*\_\_*\_\_*\_\_*\n ### **Bonus**\n Write a for loop that counts\
  \ down from 100 to 0. However, the for loop must start with for(int i = 0;  and\
  \ you may NOT have any code ABOVE your for loop.\n\n"
