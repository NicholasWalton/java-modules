  \     This recipe practices writing and calling void methods.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n\
  \     Make a new class, create a main method, and show the robot.\n    </li>\n \
  \   <li>\n     Have the robot draw a square.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Put this\
  \ code into a drawSquare() method.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Have the robot draw\
  \ a triangle.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Put this code into a drawTriangle() method.\n\

  \     Put this code into a drawCircle() method.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Ask the\
  \ user which shape they want. Draw the appropriate shape depending on their answer\
  \ (call the right method).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Ask the user which color they\
  \ want. Give them some choices so you don't have to accomodate every possible color.\
