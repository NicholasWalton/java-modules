  2. Make a new class, create a main method, and show the robot.

  3. Have the robot draw a square.

  4. Put this code into a drawSquare() method.

  6. Put this code into a drawTriangle() method.

  7. Have the robot draw a circle.

  9. Ask the user which shape they want. Draw the appropriate shape depending on their
