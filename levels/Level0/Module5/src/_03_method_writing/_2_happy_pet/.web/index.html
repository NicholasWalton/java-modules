<li>Ask the user to enter the type of pet they want (give them a few choices).</li>
                                
<li>Use a loop (maybe a while loop?) to keep offering interactions with their pet until the desired pet happiness level has been reached. Examples of activities are:   Feed, Walk, Play</li>
                                
<li>Write a method for each of the pet activities offered. Each activity should increase (or decrease) the pet's happiness level by a different amount, depending on the kind of pet they have. For example, a fish might not enjoy a walk!</li>
