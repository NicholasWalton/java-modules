  # Happy Pet


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/happyPet.png"/>


  ## Goal:


  Write methods to represent the activities that will make the user''s pet happy.


  ## Steps:


  1. Ask the user to enter the type of pet they want (give them a few choices).

  2. Use a loop (maybe a while loop?) to keep offering interactions with their pet
  until the desired pet happiness level has been reached. Examples of activities are:   Feed,
  Walk, Play

  3. Write a method for each of the pet activities offered. Each activity should increase
  (or decrease) the pet''s happiness level by a different amount, depending on the
  kind of pet they have. For example, a fish might not enjoy a walk!
