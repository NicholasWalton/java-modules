  \ that will make the user's pet happy.\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div id=\"recipeRightColumn\"\

  \     Ask the user to enter the type of pet they want (give them a few choices).\n\
  \    </li>\n    <li>\n     Use a loop (maybe a while loop?) to keep offering interactions\
  \ with their pet until the desired pet happiness level has been reached. Examples\
  \ of activities are:   Feed, Walk, Play\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Write a method\
  \ for each of the pet activities offered. Each activity should increase (or decrease)\
  \ the pet's happiness level by a different amount, depending on the kind of pet\
  \ they have. For example, a fish might not enjoy a walk!\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n\
