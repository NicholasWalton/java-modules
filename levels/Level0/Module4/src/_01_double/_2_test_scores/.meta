  \ variables to allow for decimals,\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div id=\"recipeRightColumn\"\
  >\n  <div id=\"recipeSteps\">\n   ## Steps:\n   <ol id=\"stepList\">\n    <li>\n\
  \     Write code to ask the user for their test score.\n     Your program MUST allow\
  \ the user to enter a test score that has a DECIMAL, e.g. 75.5\n    </li>\n    <li>\n\
  \     Give them a different message according to their score.\n     Example, for\
  \ a good score: \"Wow! You must have studied really hard for that test!\"\n    \
  \ HINT: Think about how you would convert a String to an int and use SIMILAR code\
  \ to convert their test score to a double.\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n  </div>\n </div>\n\
