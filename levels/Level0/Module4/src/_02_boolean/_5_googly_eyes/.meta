  \ image\" src=\"./googlyEyes.png\"/>\n  <div id=\"recipeGoal\">\n   ## Goal:\n \
  \  You\u2019re going to draw a face with eyes that will follow the mouse!\n  </div>\n\
  \ </div>\n <div id=\"recipeRightColumn\">\n  <div id=\"recipeSteps\">\n   ## Steps:\n\
  \   <ol>\n    <li>\n     Find the Googly Eyes recipe program in Eclipse.\n    </li>\n\
  \    <li>\n     Find an image on the internet and copy it to the\n     <b>\n   \
  \   /images\n     </b>\n     folder. It can be anything as long as it has large\
  \ eyes!\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     On line 1 of your program (outside of the methods)\
  \ declare a variable for the image:\n     ```\n   PImage face;\n\n```\n    </li>\n\
  \    <li>\n     In your setup() method, import your image using the following code:\n\
  \     ```\n\n    face = loadImage(\u201Cface.jpg\u201D);\n\n```\n    </li>\n   \
  \ <li>\n     If you need to, change the code you just entered so that \"face.jpg\"\
  \ matches the name of your picture.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Set the size of your\
  \ window and the size of your image to be the same by entering the following code\
  \ in the setup method.\n     ```\n    size(800,600);\n    face.resize(width,height);\n\
  \n```\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     In the draw() method, place a white ellipse over\
  \ the left eye of your image.\n     HINT: To find out where to put it, add code\
  \ to print the mouseX and mouseY where you click the mouse.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n\
  \     Now add a pupil (the black part) to the left eye earlier.\n    </li>\n   \
  \ <li>\n     Use mouseX and mouseY to move the left pupil where the mouse moves.\n\
  \    </li>\n    <li>\n     Add a white ellipse over the right eye using the same\
  \ technique used for the left eye.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Add a right pupil\
  \ and make it move by using mouseX + [distance from left eye] and mouseY + [distance\
  \ from left eye].\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Here\u2019s the tricky part: stop the\
  \ pupils from going outside of the white circles!  To do this, imagine a rectangle\
  \ that the pupil should stay within.  When mouseX and mouseY goes outside of these\
  \ bounds, set it back to the boundary.  Put this code before you draw the pupils.\n\
  \    </li>\n    <li>\n     Make sure you SAVE YOUR CODE when you are done.\n   \
  \ </li>\n   </ol>\n  </div>\n </div>\n\n"
