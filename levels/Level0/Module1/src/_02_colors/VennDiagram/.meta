  \ used in every class. If your\ninstructor has not introduced you to Processing,\
  \ you can skip this lesson. \n\n## Goal\n\nUse the RGB color model to create a Venn\
  \ Diagram that showcases your personality.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Find the Venn Diagram\
  \ recipe program ( VennDiagram.pde ) and open it using Processing.\n2. Run the program\
  \ and you should see an empty gray window.\n3. After the size() command, add code\
  \ to draw 3 circles to form a Venn Diagram (see picture).\nThe command to draw a\
  \ circle in Processing is:\n\n```\nellipse (centerX, centerY, circleWidth, circleHeight);\n\
  ```\n\nChange the values of `centerX`, `centerY`, `circleWidth` and `circleHeight`\
  \ of each\nellipse until they overlap as in the picture.\n\nRun the program. It\
  \ should look a bit like this.\n\n<center><img src=\"./whiteCircles.png\" width=\"\
  400px\"></center> \n\n\nNow to add the colors. Processing uses the following command\
  \ to draw in color:\n```\nfill(red, green, blue, opacity);\n```\n\nwhere red, green,\
  \ blue, and opacity are all numbers between 0 and 255. So to make see-through red\
  \ circles, we add the following line of code BEFORE we draw the circles.\n```\n\
  fill(255, 0, 0, 100);\n```\n\nRun the program. It should look a bit like this.\n\
  \n\n We can now see the edges of all the circles because we made\n them \"see-through\"\
  \ by setting the opacity to 100 (which is < 255) Add more\n fill commands (you will\
  \ have to figure out where to put them) so that each\n ellipse has its own unique\
  \ color. Label each of the circles with an aspect\n of your personality. Processing\
  \ uses the following command to draw text. You\n will need to put numbers in place\
  \ of xLocation, and yLocation. Play around\n with the x and y until it works with\
  \ your diagram.\n\n  ``` text\n (\"TEXT\", xLocation, yLocation); \n ```\n\nYou\
  \ can also make the text larger by changing the sizeOfLetters (you will have to\
  \ figure out where to put this)\n```\ntextSize(sizeOfLetters);\n```\n4. Change the\
  \ x and y of each ellipse until they overlap as in the picture.\n5. Run the program.\
  \ It should look a bit like this\n6. Now to add the colors. Processing uses the\
  \ following command to draw in color:\n```\nfill(red, green, blue, opacity);\n```\n\
  \nwhere red, green, blue, and opacity are all numbers between 0 and 255. So to make\
  \ see-through red circles, we add the following line of code BEFORE we draw the\
  \ circles.\n```\nfill(255, 0, 0, 100);\n```\n\nRun the program. It should look a\
  \ bit like this We can now see the edges of\nall the circles because we made them\
  \ \"see-through\" by setting the opacity to\n100 (which is < 255) Add more fill\
  \ commands (you will have to figure out\nwhere to put them) so that each ellipse\
  \ has its own unique color.\n\nLabel each of the circles with an aspect of your\
  \ personality. Processing uses\nthe following command to draw text. You will need\
  \ to put numbers in place of\nxLocation, and yLocation. Play around with the x and\
  \ y until it works with\nyour diagram.\n\n```\ntext(\"TEXT\", xLocation, yLocation);\n\
  ```\n\nYou can also make the text larger by changing the sizeOfLetters (you will\
  \ have\nto figure out where to put this)\n\n```\ntextSize(sizeOfLetters);\n```\n\
  Run the program. It should look a bit like this:\n\n\n<center><img src=\"./redCircles.png\"\
  \ width=\"400px\"></center> \n\n We can now see the edges of all the circles because\
  \ we made\n them \"see-through\" by setting the opacity to 100 (which is < 255)\n\
  \nAdd more fill commands (you will have to figure out where to put them) so that\n\
  each ellipse has its own unique color.\n\n<center><img src=\"./colorfulCircles.png\"\
