# Level0-Module0

Level 0 has coding exercises, which we call "recipies", for students who have just started programming. 

With these recipes, students will learn how to:

1. Draw shapes and images using Processing
2. Control the flow of code using if statements and loops 
3. Print Strings and use dialogs to interact with a user 
4. Build simple games using skills learned

## Navigating the Lessons

In the LEAGUE's online Java curriculum, the lessons are organized
into _levels_, _modules_, _lessons_ and _assignments_.  Every level has a
whole website, like this one.  Inside the level are modules, modules are
named with a number at the end, like "Module 0", and they will have links
with a large bold title on the left side of the page, which you can see on
the left side menu in this page. 

At the top of this page you will see two important links.

The <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://localhost:8081/assets/img/fork_button.288c2b74.png" height="25px" >
link will let you *fork* the module repository. Forking a repository will
make a copy of it in your Github account so you can work on it. 

The <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://localhost:8081/assets/img/view_button.2bc131f4.png" height="25px" >
link will take you to the module repository, so you can see all of the code
at once. This repository will be the *LEAGUE'S* repository, not yours, so you
can't change it, and won't see any of your changes. Visit your account to see
your version of the repository. 

If you visit one of the assignment pages, like [this one](http://localhost:8080/Level0/lessons/Module0/02_code_flow/)
you will see a  <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="https://github.com/league-curriculum/league-curriculum/blob/master/docs/src/java/source_link.png?raw=true" height="25px">
 link. This link will take you into the Module repositopry, to the specific
directory that has the assignment you are working on.
