In this lesson you will learn to use loops and logical conditions
to make choices. 

To complete these lessons, you should:

* Visit your Github account on [Github.com](https://github.com)
* Look for the Repository named `Level0-Module0`
* Click on the green "Code" button.
* Select the "Codespaces" tab
* If you have a Green button that reads "Create codespace on main", click on it
* If you don't have that green button, you have a running code space. Either open the window where it is running, or click on the name of the code space in the popup window.
