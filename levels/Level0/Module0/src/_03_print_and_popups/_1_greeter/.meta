  ## Goal:


  Print a global greeting to the console. Then use input and message dialogs to join
  Strings and send the user a friendly greeting!


  ## Steps:


  1. Create a new class called Greeter.

  2. Add a main method. Eclipse has a helpful schortcut - main

  3. Print "Hello World!" to the console. Eclipse has a helpful schortcut - syso

  4. Now ask the user for their name. The code looks like this:

  ```


  String input = JOptionPane.showInputDialog("What is your name?");

  ```

  5. Join their name to the end of this greeting. The code looks like this.

  ```


  JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"Hello "+input);

  ```
