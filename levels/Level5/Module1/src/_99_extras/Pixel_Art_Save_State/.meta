text: "<html>\n ### \nModify the Pixel Art Maker program you created in Level 4. \n\
  Add a save button that will save the state of the image. When the program is started,\
  \ \nit should load the image from the file and display it on the grid.\n\nIf you\
  \ have not completed the Pixel Art Maker program, now would be a great time to do\
  \ so.\n</html>\n"
