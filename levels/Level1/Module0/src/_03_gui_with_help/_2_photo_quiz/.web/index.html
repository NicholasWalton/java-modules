We are going to use GUI components to make quiz that shows images to the player and asks them questions relating to the images they see.

<li>Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. JFrames are invisible when you create them, so you will need to make it visible (follow instructions in the code).</li>
                                
<li>Create a Component. Call the method provided, to put an image (icon) into the Component (follow instructions in the code).</li>
                                
<li>Add the Component to the JFrame (follow instructions in the code).</li>
                                
<li>Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that its components are visible. If you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame should be packed again.</li>

<li>Use a pop-up to ask the user a question relating to the image and tell them if they get the right answer. </li>
                                
<li>Replace the Component with another that has a different image and ask a new question (follow instructions in the code).</li>
