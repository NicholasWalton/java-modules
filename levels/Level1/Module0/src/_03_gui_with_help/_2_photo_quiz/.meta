  # Photo Quiz


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/photoQuiz.png"/>


  ## Goal:


  We are going to use GUI components to make quiz that shows images to the player
  and asks them questions relating to the images they see.


  ## Steps:


  1. Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. JFrames are
  invisible when you create them, so you will need to make it visible (follow instructions
  in the code).

  2. Create a Component. Call the method provided, to put an image (icon) into the
  Component (follow instructions in the code).

  3. Add the Component to the JFrame (follow instructions in the code).

  4. Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that its components are visible.
  If you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame should be packed
  again.

  5. Use a pop-up to ask the user a question relating to the image and tell them if
  they get the right answer.

  6. Replace the Component with another that has a different image and ask a new question
  (follow instructions in the code).
