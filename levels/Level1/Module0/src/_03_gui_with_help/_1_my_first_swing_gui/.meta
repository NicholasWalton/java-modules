  # My First Swing GUI


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/myFirstSwingGui.png"/>


  ## Goal:


  We are going to make a simple GUI (pronounced gooey). GUI stands for Graphical User
  Interface, which in this case means a window and everything that is drawn on it.
  The user will see a window (frame) with a greeting and image similar to the one
  shown above.


  ## Steps:


  1. Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. It will contain
  one component of your GUI. In this program, it will contain a JPanel (see next).
  JFrames are invisible when you create them, so you will need to make it visible
  (follow instructions in the code).

  2. Create a JPanel and add it to the JFrame. A JPanel is a simple container that
  provides space for your program to add more components. In this program, it will
  contain a JLabel (see next).

  3. Create a JLabel and add it to the JPanel. A JLabel allows you to display small
  amounts of text, and/or an image. In this program, both will be displayed (follow
  instructions in the code).

  4. Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that the its components are visible.
  If you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame should be packed
  again.
