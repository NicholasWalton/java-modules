  ./myFirstSwingGui.png\"/>\n  <div id=\"recipeGoal\">\n   ## Goal:\n   We are going\
  \ to make a simple GUI (pronounced gooey). GUI stands for Graphical User Interface,\
  \ which in this case means a window and everything that is drawn on it. The user\
  \ will see a window (frame) with a greeting and image similar to the one shown above.\n\
  \  </div>\n </div>\n <div id=\"recipeRightColumn\">\n  <div id=\"recipeSteps\">\n\
  \   ## Steps:\n   <ol id=\"stepList\">\n    <li>\n     Create a JFrame. A JFrame\
  \ is a window that has a border and title. It will contain one component of your\
  \ GUI. In this program, it will contain a JPanel (see next). JFrames are invisible\
  \ when you create them, so you will need to make it visible (follow instructions\
  \ in the code).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Create a JPanel and add it to the JFrame.\
  \ A JPanel is a simple container that provides space for your program to add more\
  \ components. In this program, it will contain a JLabel (see next).\n    </li>\n\
  \    <li>\n     Create a JLabel and add it to the JPanel. A JLabel allows you to\
  \ display small amounts of text, and/or an image. In this program, both will be\
  \ displayed (follow instructions in the code).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Packing\
  \ a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that the its components are visible. If\
  \ you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame should be packed\
  \ again.\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n  </div>\n </div>\n\n"
