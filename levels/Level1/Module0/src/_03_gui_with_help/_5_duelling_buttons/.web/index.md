## Goal:
   We are going to use GUI components to make demanding buttons that will compete in a duel for the uer's attention. When the user clicks on one button, the other button will demand to be clicked on!
## Steps:
1. A JFrame, JPanel, and two JButtons have already been created. You set the text of both buttons to "Click Me". When you pack the JFrame and run the program, it should look like this: 
2. Add this ActionListener to both buttons. Then modify the actionPerformed() method to make the buttons change their text and size when the user clicks (follow instructions in the code).
