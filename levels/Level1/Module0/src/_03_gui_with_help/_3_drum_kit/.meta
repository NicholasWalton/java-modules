  />\n  <div id=\"recipeGoal\">\n   ## Goal:\n   We are going to use GUI components\
  \ to make drum kit. When different images of the drum kit are clicked, they will\
  \ play appropriate sounds.\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div id=\"recipeRightColumn\">\n\
  \  <div id=\"recipeSteps\">\n   ## Steps:\n   <ol id=\"stepList\">\n    <li>\n \
  \    Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. It will\
  \ contain one component of your GUI. In this program, it will contain a JPanel (see\
  \ next). JFrames are invisible when you create them, so you will need to make it\
  \ visible (follow instructions in the code).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Create a\
  \ JPanel and add it to the JFrame.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Create a JLabel that\
  \ shows the image of a drum (follow instructions in the code) and add it to the\
  \ JPanel.\n     <li>\n      Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that\
  \ its components are visible. If you do anything to change the size of its contents,\
  \ a JFrame should be packed again.\n     </li>\n     <li>\n      When you run the\
  \ program you should see the drum\n      <img src=\"./drum.png\"/>\n     </li>\n\
  \    </li>\n    <li>\n     Add a MouseListener to the JLabel and complete the mouseClicked()\
  \ method so that a drum sound is played when the drum image is clicked (follow instructions\
  \ in the code).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Repeat the above steps for a second JLabel\
  \ that shows the image of a cymbal (follow instructions in the code).\n    </li>\n\
  \    <li>\n     Your drum kit is complete!\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n  </div>\n </div>\n\
