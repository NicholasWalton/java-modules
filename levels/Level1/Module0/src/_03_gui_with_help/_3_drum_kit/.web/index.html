We are going to use GUI components to make drum kit. When different images of the drum kit are clicked, they will play appropriate sounds.

<li>Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. It will contain one component of your GUI. In this program, it will contain a JPanel (see next). JFrames are invisible when you create them, so you will need to make it visible (follow instructions in the code).</li>
                                
<li>Create a JPanel and add it to the JFrame. </li>
                                
<li>Create a JLabel that shows the image of a drum (follow instructions in the code) and add it to the JPanel.
                                
                                
<li>Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that its components are visible. If you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame should be packed again.</li>
                                
                                <li>When you run the program you should see the drum <img src="images/drum.png"></li></li>

<li>Add a MouseListener to the JLabel and complete the mouseClicked() method so that a drum sound is played when the drum image is clicked (follow instructions in the code).</li>
                                
<li>Repeat the above steps for a second JLabel that shows the image of a cymbal (follow instructions in the code).</li>

<li>Your drum kit is complete!</li>
