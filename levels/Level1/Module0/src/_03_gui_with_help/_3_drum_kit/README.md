## Goal:

We are going to use GUI components to make drum kit. When different images of the drum kit are clicked, they will play appropriate sounds.

## Steps:

1. Create a JFrame. A JFrame is a window that has a border and title. It will contain one component of your GUI. In this program, it will contain a JPanel (see next). JFrames are invisible when you create them, so you will need to make it visible (follow instructions in the code).
2. Create a JPanel and add it to the JFrame.
3. Create a JLabel that shows the image of a drum (follow instructions in the code) and add it to the JPanel.


Packing a JFrame causes it to resize itself so that its components are visible. If you do anything to change the size of its contents, a JFrame should be packed again.
When you run the program you should see the drum

6. Add a MouseListener to the JLabel and complete the mouseClicked() method so that a drum sound is played when the drum image is clicked (follow instructions in the code).
7. Repeat the above steps for a second JLabel that shows the image of a cymbal (follow instructions in the code).
8. Your drum kit is complete!
