# Body Part Quiz

<hr/>
<img src="./images/bodyPart.png"/>

## Goal:

We are going to use GUI components to make a quiz in which only part of an image is displayed (like the one shown above). The player has to guess the name of each celebrity shown.

## Steps:

1. The program already contains a JFrame and JPanel. There is also a selection of celebrity photos which you can use for the quiz (or replace them with your own selection).
2. Your challenge is to resize the frame so that only part of the celebrity's face is shown.
3. Ask the user to guess who each person is and keep a score of how many they get correct.

End the program when there are no more images to display.
4. End the program when there are no more images to display.
