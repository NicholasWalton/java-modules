  # Body Part Quiz


  <hr/>

  <img src="./images/bodyPart.png"/>


  ## Goal:


  We are going to use GUI components to make a quiz in which only part of an image
  is displayed (like the one shown above). The player has to guess the name of each
  celebrity shown.


  ## Steps:


  1. The program already contains a JFrame and JPanel. There is also a selection of
  celebrity photos which you can use for the quiz (or replace them with your own selection).

  2. Your challenge is to resize the frame so that only part of the celebrity''s face
  is shown.

  3. Ask the user to guess who each person is and keep a score of how many they get
  correct.


  End the program when there are no more images to display.

  4. End the program when there are no more images to display.
