  ./bodyPart.png\"/>\n  <div id=\"recipeGoal\">\n   ## Goal:\n   We are going to use\
  \ GUI components to make a quiz in which only part of an image is displayed (like\
  \ the one shown above). The player has to guess the name of each celebrity shown.\n\
  \  </div>\n </div>\n <div id=\"recipeRightColumn\">\n  <div id=\"recipeSteps\">\n\
  \   ## Steps:\n   <ol id=\"stepList\">\n    <li>\n     The program already contains\
  \ a JFrame and JPanel. There is also a selection of celebrity photos which you can\
  \ use for the quiz (or replace them with your own selection).\n    </li>\n    <li>\n\
  \     Your challenge is to resize the frame so that only part of the celebrity's\
  \ face is shown.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n     Ask the user to guess who each person\
  \ is and keep a score of how many they get correct.\n     <li>\n      End the program\
  \ when there are no more images to display.\n     </li>\n    </li>\n   </ol>\n \
  \ </div>\n </div>\n\n"
