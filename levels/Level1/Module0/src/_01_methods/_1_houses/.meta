  \ side of the window near the bottom.\n\n\n    2. Draw a flat-topped house of height\
  \ 100 with grass after it (see picture).\n\n\n    3. Extract the piece of code that\
  \ draws the house into a method. Draw 10 houses. \n\n\n    4. Change the method\
  \ to take (int height) as a parameter. Draw 9 houses of different heights \n\n\n\
  \    5. Make the method take a String instead of an int. \n\n\n    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\

  \ peaked roofs \n\n\n    8. Extract that roof code into a method \u201CdrawPointyRoof\u201D\
  \ and create a new method: \u201CdrawFlatRoof\u201D.\n\n\n    9. Make large houses\
  \ have flat roofs\n </div>\n\n"
