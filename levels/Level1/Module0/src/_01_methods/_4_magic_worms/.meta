text: "\n\n# Magic Worms\n\n1. Start a new sketch with draw, setup, and settings methods.\n\
  \n2. Set your canvas size and background color in the settings() method\n```\n \
  \   size(width, height\n    background(red, green, blue)\n```\n3. In your draw method,\
  \ use a for loop to draw 300 ellipses in a diagonal line across the canvas.\nRUN\
  \ THE PROGRAM TO CHECK IT.\n4. Now change the x and y location of each ellipse to\
  \ \"different\" random numbers that are inside the canvas. Note: random() returns\
  \ values that are type float so your x and y variable types should also be float.\n\
  RUN THE PROGRAM TO CHECK IT.\n```\n   random(int maxValue)\n```\n5. Set the color\
  \ of each ellipse.\nRUN THE PROGRAM TO CHECK IT.\n```\n    fill(red, green, blue)\n\
  ```\n6.  If this code isn't already in your file, paste this code at the bottom.\n\
  ```\n    float frequency = .001;\n    float noiseInterval = PI;\n\n    void makeMagical()\
  \ {\n        fill( 0, 0, 0, 10 );\n        rect(0, 0, width, height);\n        noStroke();\n\
  \    }\n\n    float getWormX(int i) {\n        return map(noise(i*noiseInterval\
  \ + frameCount * frequency), 0, 1, 0, width);\n    }\n\n    float getWormY(int i)\
  \ {\n        return map(noise(i*noiseInterval+1 + frameCount * frequency), 0, 1,\
  \ 0, height);\n    }\n```\n7. Now change the x and y location of each ellipse to\
  \ the value returned by the getWormX() and getWormY() methods (use the for loop\
  \ variable as the parameter to these methods).\nRUN THE PROGRAM TO CHECK IT.\n8.\
  \ Call makeMagical() in your draw method before the for loop.  OPTIONS: Pass in\
  \ frameCount or another variable for the ellipse \"red value\", and i as the \"\
  green value\" for some extra color coolness.\nRUN THE PROGRAM TO CHECK IT.\n10.\
  \ You can adjust the frequency and noiseInterval variables to your liking. Also\
  \ play with the number and size of particles (ellipses) until it looks amazing.\n\
  11. [Optional] Add another worm every time the user clicks the mouse.\n\n\n"
