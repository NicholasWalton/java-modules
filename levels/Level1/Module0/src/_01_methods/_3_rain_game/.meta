  \ setup, and settings methods.\n\n2. Set your canvas size in the settings() method\n\
  \  ```\n    size(width, height)\n```\n  and your background color in the draw method\n\
  \  ```\n    background(red, green, blue)\n```\n  3. Draw a raindrop at the top of\
  \ the screen in the draw() method.\n  ```\n\n    fill(red, green, blue);\n    stroke(red,\
  \ green, blue);\n    ellipse(x, y, width, height);\n```\n  4. Make the rain fall\
  \ down the screen.\n   \_\_\_\_\_ Hint: make a variable for the raindrop's Y position\
  \ and change it in the draw method.\n  5. When the rain falls off the bottom of\
  \ the canvas, start a new rain drop falling from the top.\n  6.  Make the rain start\
  \ at a random position (X position) at the top. This code will give you a random\
  \ number between 0 and the width of your sketch.\n  ```\n      int randomNumber\
  \ = (int) random(width);\n```\n  7. Draw a bucket at the bottom of the screen.\n\
  \  ```\n        rect(int x, int y, int width, int height);\n```\n  8. Make the bucket\
  \ move over and back with the mouse. Hint: mouseX\n  9. Add an int variable to hold\
  \ the score (above the setup method). If the rain falls in the bucket increase the\
  \ score by 1. If it doesn\u2019t, decrease the score by 1, but don\u2019t let the\
  \ score go negative. Figure it out by yourself or use this method\u2026\n\n    void\
  \ checkCatch(int x){\n         if (x &gt; mouseX &amp;&amp; x &lt; mouseX+100)\n\
  \            score++;\n         else if (score &gt; 0) \n            score--;\n\
  \        println(\"Your score is now: \" + score);\n    }\n\n  10. Print the score\
  \ on the screen.\n\n    fill(0, 0, 0);\n    textSize(16);\n    text(\"Score: \"\
  \ + score, 20, 20);\n </div>\n\n"
