  # Slot Machine


  We are going to make a slot machine.

  The slot machine we are going to make, will look a little like the middle row on
  this image:

  First, find 3 images for the slot machine to display, e.g. cherry, orange, lime.


  Each "reel" of the slot machine will randomly display one of 3 images you have chosen
  (you can add more images later if there is time).


  Put a "SPIN" button onto the frame that causes each of the 3 "reels" to randomly
  change the image they are showing.


  If all 3 reels have the same image showing (like in the picture above), the player
  wins. Display a "YOU WIN" message, optionally add a sound of success, and if you
  are still having fun - update a win counter to show the user how many times they
  have won.


  You may find the code below helpful:


  private JLabel createLabelImage(String fileName) throws MalformedURLException{

  URL imageURL = getClass().getResource(fileName);

  if (imageURL == null){

  System.err.println("Could not find image " + fileName);

  return new JLabel();

  }

  Icon icon = new ImageIcon(imageURL);

  JLabel imageLabel = new JLabel(icon);

  return imageLabel;

  }
