1. Make a UI that looks something like this:

2. Using the PigLatinTranslator class in the package, create a program that:
* Translates a word in English to Pig Latin when a button is pressed.
* Translates a word in Pig Latin to English when a button is pressed.
* Make the computer speak the Pig Latin phrase (using Sound.speak(words)) when a button is pressed.
