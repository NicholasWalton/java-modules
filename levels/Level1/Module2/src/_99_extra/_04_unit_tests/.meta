text: "\n <div id=\"moduleIndex\">\n  # Intro to Unit Tests\n  An important part of\
  \ coding is testing to see if your code is working correctly. Instead of asking\
  \ a person to run the program each time it is changed to make sure it still runs\
  \ properly, we can make much more reliable automated tests to check it out. These\
  \ are known as unit tests.\n  Test-driven development (TDD) is a way of developing\
  \ code where you write the tests before you even start writing the program.  It\u2019\
  s a way to think through what your code must be able to do before your write it.\n\
  \  ### JUnit Tests\n  JUnit is an open source framework designed for the purpose\
  \ of writing and running tests for java programs.\n\nTests can be written that specify\
  \ the expected return value from running some code. \n    The syntax for the tests\
  \ looks like this:\n  assertEquals(expected, actual)\n  If the \"expected\" value\
  \ matches the \"actual\" value, the results bar displayed after running the tests\
  \ will be green. If they are different (or there are errors), the results bar will\
  \ be red.\n\nFor example, in the context of the \"real world\"\n  assertEquals(true,\
  \ Is water wet?)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_results bar will be green\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   assertEquals(true,\
  \ Are zombies  real?)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_results bar will be red\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   assertEquals(false,\
  \ Is coding lame?)\_\_\_\_\_\_\_results bar will be green\n  Now for some real code.\
  \ Will the results bar be green or red for these asserts?\n  assertEquals(4, add(2,2));\n\
  \n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_assertEquals(\u201Cbrains\u201D, getZombieFood());\n\n\_\_\_\_\_\
  \_\_assertEquals(2, getLargest(3,2));\n </div>\n\n"
