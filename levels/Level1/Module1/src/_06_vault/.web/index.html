<h1>Vault</h1>
<br>
    <p class="normal">
        A vault stands in the way of your progress. We need a secret agent to find the code to get through.</p> 
<br>
        <p class="normal">
     1. You have been given a Vault class that describes how the vault will work. It has a secret code that will be randomly chosen each time the program is run.
	 <br> It also contains a tryCode() method that takes a <font color="green">number</font> as a parameter and returns <font color="magenta">true</font> if that number opens the vault, <font color="magenta">false</font> otherwise.<br>
    <br>
2. Create a Runner class with a main method. Create a vault object and call the tryCode() method. Print out the answer to see if you successfully opened the vault.<br>
    <br>
3. Make a SecretAgent class that has a method findCode() that takes a Vault as a parameter.<br>
     The codes are between 0 and 1 million. This method will try all the codes, and return the first code that opens the vault, or -1 if no code opened the vault.<br>
<br>
4. Add the SecretAgent object to main. Use a syso to print the result from findCode()<br>
