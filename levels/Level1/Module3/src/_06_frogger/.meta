  \ Ask your teacher if you do not know how to do this.\n\n2.  In the settings method,\
  \ set your canvas of size 800x600 for your game\nsize(width, height);\nIn the draw\
  \ method, set the background color of your sketch\nbackground(red,green,blue);\n\
  3. In the draw method, draw a frog on the bottom of the canvas. (It can be a ball\
  \ for now)\nfill(red, green, blue);\nellipse(x, y, width, height);\n4. Make member\
  \ variables to keep track of your frog\u2019s hop distance, x and y position\n5.\
  \ Add code to the method below (match the code to the comments) to give our frog\
  \ movement.\n```\nvoid keyPressed()\n{\n    if(key == CODED){\n        if(keyCode\
  \ == UP)\n        {\n            //Frog Y position goes up\n        }\n        else\
  \ if(keyCode == DOWN)\n        {\n            //Frog Y position goes down \n   \
  \     }\n        else if(keyCode == RIGHT)\n        {\n            //Frog X position\
  \ goes right\n        }\n        else if(keyCode == LEFT)\n        {\n         \
  \   //Frog X position goes left\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n6. Write a method to\
  \ keep our frog from going outside of the canvas\n7. Create a new Car class in Eclipse.\
  \ Your Car class will include the car\u2019s x position, y position, the size of\
  \ the car, and the speed of the car.\n8. Create a constructor for your Car class\
  \ that initializes each member variable with parameters.\n9. Copy this functionality\
  \ into your Car class to display your car\n```\nvoid display()\n  {\n    fill(0,255,0);\n\
  \    rect(x , y,  size, 50);\n  }\n```\n10. Declare several Car member variables\
  \ inside your class and initialize them in the setup method.\n11. Call the display()\
  \ method from your draw method for each car. You should see your cars appear.\n\
  12. Inside your Car class write a method for the car to move to the left with its\
  \ speed.\n13. Inside your Car class write a method for the car to move to the left\
  \ with its speed. In the same method, if the car goes off the canvas, have it return\
  \ to the rightmost position of your canvas.  (hint: use Processing's width variable)\n\
  14.  Write another method for the car to move to the right with its speed. In the\
  \ same method,  if the car goes off the canvas, have it return to the leftmost position\
  \ of your canvas\n15.  In the draw() method, alternate the driving direction of\
  \ each of your cars to either go left or right. Use the display() method after every\
  \ drive method.\n16. Create getX(), getY(), and getSize() methods in your Car class.\n\
  17. Check when a car hits your frog. You can use the following intersection method\
  \ to help.\n```\nboolean intersects(Car car) {\n if ((frogY > car.getY() && frogY\
  \ < car.getY()+50) &&\n                (frogX > car.getX() && frogX < car.getX()+car.getSize()))\
  \ {\n   return true;\n  }\n else  {\n  return false;\n }\n```\n18. Call the intersects\
  \ method for one of your cars in your draw method.  If the intersects method returns\
  \ true, return your frog to the starting point.\n19. Repeat step 18 for all of your\
  \ cars.\n20. OPTIONAL.   Use images for the background, cars and frog (see image\
  \ at top). You can find your own images, or those provided in the Module 3 Java\
  \ project. See below for code snippets to load and draw images.\n```\n\n PImage\
  \ back;\n PImage carLeft;\n PImage carRight;\n PImage frog;\n    void settings(){\n\
  \        size(844,600);\n    }\n    void setup() {\n        back = loadImage(\"\
  froggerBackground.png\");\n        carLeft = loadImage(\"carLeft.png\");\n     \
  \   carLeft.resize(160,100);\n        carRight = loadImage(\"carRight.png\");\n\
  \        carRight.resize(160,100);\n        frog = loadImage(\"frog.png\");\n  \
  \      frog.resize(75,75);\n    }\n    void draw() {\n        background(back);\n\
  \        image (carLeft,250,360);\n        image (carRight,250, 210);\n        image\
  \ (frog, 300, 530);\n    }\n```\n\n\n"
