text: "\n <div id=\"moduleIndex\">\n  # Gridworld\n  In this exercise we\u2019ll use\
  \ OBJECTS and METHODS to make a world that contains bugs and flowers.\n  Before\
  \ you start, you need to make sure that the gridworld.jar is in the build path of\
  \ your Java project as follows:\n\n    Right click your Java project (ask your teacher\
  \ if you do not know how to find this), then click Build Path. Configure Build Path,\
  \ and make sure  gridworld.jar is under the Libraries tab\n\n\t If you cannot find\
  \ it, ask your teacher to help you get it into your Java project.\n  First create\
  \ a runner class for your program called Gridworld.\n  Now use this chart to help\
  \ you complete the following challenges:\n\n\_\_\_\_1.  Figure out how to get a\
  \ World to show.\n\n\_\_\_\_2.  Figure out how to add a Bug to the world (clue:\
  \ you will need the Bug and Location objects)\n\n\_\_\_\_3.  Add another bug at\
  \ a random location in the world.\n\n\_\_\_\_4.  Change the color of that bug to\
  \ blue.\n\n     \_\_\_\_5.  Make the bug face to the right.\n\n     \_\_\_\_6. \
  \ Add flowers to the left and right of the bug.\n\n     \_\_\_\_7.  Fill the whole\
  \ world with flowers!\n\n\_\_\_\_8.  [Optional] Color the flowers in rows like the\
  \ American flag (red &amp; white)\n\n     \_\_\_\_9.  [Optional] Use a new class\
  \ to make an X out of bugs.\n </div>\n\n"
