text: "\n\n# Gridworld\n\nIn this exercise we\u2019ll use OBJECTS and METHODS to make\
  \ a world that contains bugs and flowers.\nBefore you start, you need to make sure\
  \ that the gridworld.jar is in the build path of your Java project as follows:\n\
  \nRight click your Java project (ask your teacher if you do not know how to find\
  \ this), then click Build Path. Configure Build Path, and make sure  gridworld.jar\
  \ is under the Libraries tab\n\nIf you cannot find it, ask your teacher to help\
  \ you get it into your Java project.\nFirst create a runner class for your program\
  \ called Gridworld.\nNow use this chart to help you complete the following challenges:\n\
  \n1.  Figure out how to get a World to show.\n\n2.  Figure out how to add a Bug\
  \ to the world (clue: you will need the Bug and Location objects)\n\n3.  Add another\
  \ bug at a random location in the world.\n\n4.  Change the color of that bug to\
  \ blue.\n\n5.  Make the bug face to the right.\n\n6.  Add flowers to the left and\
  \ right of the bug.\n\n7.  Fill the whole world with flowers!\n\n8.  [Optional]\
  \ Color the flowers in rows like the American flag (red & white)\n\n9.  [Optional]\
  \ Use a new class to make an X out of bugs.\n\n\n"
