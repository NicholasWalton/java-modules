// 1. Run this empty program 
// The grey square that appears has sides that are 100 pixels long

// 2. Code a size command to make it big enough for your picture

//    The size command looks like this:      
size (300,300);

ellipse(150,150, 100,100);
  
rect(250,250, 100,100);

fill(#FFA850);

// 6. The next shape you draw will be in the color you selected. 
//    NOTE: You have to put the fill command with the color you want, 
//    BEFORE you draw the shape.

// 7. Now use all these shapes and colors to draw a picture of your own design. 

// MAKE SURE YOU SAVE YOUR CODE
