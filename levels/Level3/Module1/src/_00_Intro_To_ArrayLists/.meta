text: "\n # Array List\n Variables are used to hold a single value. For example:\n\
  \ int age = 12; \nString name = \u201CSarah\u201D;\n However, what if a program\
  \ needed a list of names? We don't want to declare multiple variables with meaningless\
  \ names like name1, name2, name3, etc.\nArrays allow us to store multiple values\
  \ of the same type. E.g.\n String[] names = {\"Sarah\", \"Joe\",\"Ali\", \"Jose\"\
  };\nString[] moreNames = new String[4];\n Unfortunately, we need to know exactly\
  \ how many elements we are going to get before we can declare the array, which limits\
  \ their use in our programs.\n\n\n  This is where ArrayList comes in handy. \n\n\
  ArrayLists grow and shrink according to how many elements are currently stored in\
  \ them, i.e. they are \"dynamic\". In addition, you can add a mixture of object\
  \ types in a single ArrayList.\n ArrayList namesList = new ArrayList();\n    namesList.add(\"\
  Sarah\");\n\tnamesList.add(10);\n\tnamesList.add(3.14);\n However, if you want to\
  \ limit an ArrayList to a specific type of object, you can declare its type when\
  \ you create it:\n ArrayList&lt;String&gt; namesList = new ArrayList();\nnamesList.add(\"\
  Sarah\");\n Things to find out before you finish this module:\n How to create and\
  \ inititialize an ArrayList\nHow to add and remove items from an ArrayList\nHow\
  \ to loop through all the elements of an ArrayList (advantages and disadvantages\
  \ of different types of loop)\nAdvantages and disadvantages of ArrayLists\n <div\
