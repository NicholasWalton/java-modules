     * Task:
     * Your task is to create a function that turns a string into a Wave.
     * You will be passed a string and you must return that string in an
     * ArrayList where an uppercase letter is a person standing up.
     * Example:
     * wave("hello") => "Hello", "hEllo", "heLlo", "helLo", "hellO"
     * 
     * 1. The input string will always be lower case but maybe empty.
     * 2. If the character in the string is whitespace then pass over it as
     *    if it was an empty seat.
