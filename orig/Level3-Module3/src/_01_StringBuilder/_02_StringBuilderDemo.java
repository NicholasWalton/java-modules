     * StringBuilder is a class that lets you build a String from a list.
     * Why is the StringBuilder class even needed if we can make a String by
     * just doing: String str = "Why do we need StringBuilder?"
     * 
     * Since Strings are immutable (unchangeable), making modifications to a
     * String can mean creating another entirely new String and copying over
     * any characters from the original String in order to make the new one.
     * For example the code:
     *   String newStr = oldStr + "s";
     *
     * Here there are potentially 2 new Strings that are created just to add
     * a "s" at the end of oldStr. This is very inefficient. A more efficient
     * way to do this would be to add space for 1 more character at the end of
     * oldStr and insert the "s". This can't be done because in Java Strings
     * are immutable.
     * 
     * This is where StringBuilder comes in. StringBuilder is mutable
     * (changeable) and only finalizes the characters into a String when the
     * toString() method is called. This means our code can be much more
     * efficient than Strings, especially when adding or removing characters
     * many times.
     * 
     * Below is a demo on how to use StringBuilder.
